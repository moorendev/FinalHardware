Final exam submission 100785826

I designed this controller using knowledge gained from the group project I worked on earlier this semester. The joystick functions as a directional hat, using a housing design I actually had the opportunity to test in real life. There are 5 digital buttons in the controller, with four controlling directional inputs and one controlling the ghost's "invisibility" ability. The design is inspired from a plug 'n' play namco controller I used as a kid.
